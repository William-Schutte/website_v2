    intro: `I spent 2021 working for a startup devloping web-based computational chemistry software used by
      labs and pharmaceutical companies to evaluate drug candidates. The software frontend is built with React,

      alongside other services using Django and PostgreSQL.`,
    bulletPoints: [
      `Built, maintained, and updated web-based computational chemistry software on a React, Django, PostgreSQL, C++, TCL stack with an
      agile startup team of intranational developers`,
      `Refactored legacy JQuery/JS components into modern React functional components with Material UI elements, React context, and hooks`,
      `Implemented 3rd party API’s and libraries like 3Dmol.js, RDKit, ESLint, and Next.js to display complex 3D graphics and provide
        users with advanced chemical modeling tools`,
